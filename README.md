# Megan Hussey - R Shiny Homework 2 (Shiny Dashboard)
Homework 2 for the R Shiny course, Spring 2023.

## The data
I am using the same data from my homework 1 R Shiny app. The data is from Kaggle on the environmental impact of food production. Link to dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/selfvivek/environment-impact-of-food-production

Some notes and clarifications:

- Kg CO2 = Greenhouse emmisions(Kg CO2 - equivalents per kg product). These represent greenhouse gas emissions per kg of food product(Kg CO2 - equivalents per kg product) across different stages in the lifecycle of food production.
- Eutrophication: the pollution of water bodies and ecosystems with excess nutrients. Occurs when the environment becomes enriched with nutrients, increasing the amount of plant and algae growth to estuaries and coastal waters. Usually caused by fertilizers, animal feed, sewage discharge, etc.
